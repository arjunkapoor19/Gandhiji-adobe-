<p>Goal 1: No poverty -</p><br>
Eradicating poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. While the number of people living in 
extreme poverty dropped by more than half between 1990 and 2015, too many are still struggling for the most basic human needs.
As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation. Rapid 
growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are more likely to 
be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.Progress has also been limited in other regions, 
such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which account for 80 percent of those living in extreme poverty. New threats brought on by 
climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.The SDGs are a bold commitment 
to finish what we started, and end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This involves targeting the most vulnerable, increasing 
basic resources and services, and supporting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.<br><br><br><br>
